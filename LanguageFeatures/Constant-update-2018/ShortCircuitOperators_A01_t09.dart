/**
 * @assertion The [&&] operator is now short-circuit in constant and potentially
 * constant expressions. It only attempts to evaluate the second operand if the
 * first operand evaluates to [true]. This makes [false && (null as
 * String).length] a valid constant expression. The second operand expression
 * still needs to be a potentially constant expression, which is a new use of
 * potentially constant expressions outside of [const] constructor initializer
 * lists.
 * @description Checks that compile error is thrown if the first [&&] operand is
 * [false] and the second one is not [bool] in the potentially constant
 * expression.
